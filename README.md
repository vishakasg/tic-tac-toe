# tic-tac-toe
My first solo project for the General Assembly SEI course is Tic Tac Toe. 

## 💻 [Click here](https://vishakasg.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) to see my live project!
## 📄 About
- This is a basic version of the popular game Tic Tac Toe. 
- X and O are the first and second players in the two-player game.
- On a 3x3 grid, players take turns selecting their moves in turn. 
- The winner is the first person to successfully occupy three adjacent slots in a row, column, or diagonal. 
- If neither player has won and all available spots on the board have been taken, the game is a draw.




- Add in-app screenshots.
## ✏️ Planning and Problem Solving
- Since this project is my first significant entry into software engineering, it was essential for me to invest my time organising the structure of the programme, defining its components and how they interact, and taking small incremental steps rather than focusing  the final outcome straight away.
- Add screenshots/drawings of doodles/plans during the planning phase.
- Flow charts of app logic.
