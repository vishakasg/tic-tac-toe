# tic-tac-toe
My first solo project for the General Assembly SEI course is Tic Tac Toe. It is a simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O play against each other using a 3×3 board.

## 📄 About
- This is a basic version of the popular game Tic Tac Toe. 
- X and O are the first and second players in the two-player game.
- On a 3x3 grid, players take turns selecting their moves in turn. 
- The winner is the first person to successfully occupy three adjacent slots in a row, column, or diagonal. 
- If neither player has won and all available spots on the board have been taken, the game is a draw.
- Add in-app screenshots.

## ✏️ Planning and Problem Solving
- Since this project is my first significant entry into software engineering, it was essential for me to invest my time organising the structure of the programme, defining its components and how they interact, and taking small incremental steps rather than focusing  the final outcome straight away.
- I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a functional game.
- I created the HTML file and applied some fundamental CSS styling after sketching  a wireframe diagram and going over my user stories. Then I worked through the game logic by making a flow chart to find a solution to the issue of identifying user clicks on the board and switching the board component in accordance with the game's specifications.
- After I began manipulating the DOM using javascript, I felt somewhat more confident about the work I'm doing.
- In order to become proficient in  javaScript features and syntax, best practises for programming, and to debug mistakes and defects in the codes, I frequently referred to the multiple  sources of information throughout the development process. These sources comprise GA code_alongs, external blogs and online resources, as well as communicating with IAs about concerns.
